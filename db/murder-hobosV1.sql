Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren&#39;t affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 10d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(2,'Absorb Elements (EE)','1','Abjuration','1 reaction, which you take when you take acid, col','1 round','Self',0,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(3,'Acid Splash','0','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spells damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th Level (2d6), 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).&lt;/p&gt;',1),(4,'Aganazzar\'s Scorcher (EE)','2','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','30 feet',1,1,1,'A red dragon\'s scale',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose.

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target&#39;s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target&#39;s hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(6,'Alarm','1','Abjuration','1 minute','8 hours','30 feet',1,1,1,'A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won&#39;t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(7,'Alter Self','2','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquatic Adaptation: You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills, and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change Appearance: You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also don&#39;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same, if you&#39;re bipedal, you can&#39;t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural Weapons: You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with you unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(8,'Animal Friendship','1','Enchantment','1 action','24 hours','30 feet',1,1,1,'A morsel of food',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast&#39;s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell&#39;s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 2nd level spell slot or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(9,'Animal Messenger','2','Enchantment','1 action','24 hours','30 feet',1,1,1,'A morsel of food',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue ray, or a bird. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard or a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat. You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell towards the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger or 25 miles for other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn&#39;t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(10,'Animal Shapes','8','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 24 hours','30 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your actions to transform affected creatures into new forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target&#39;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit point it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak or cast spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The target can&#39;t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(11,'Animate Dead','3','Necromancy','1 minute','Instantaneous','10 feet',1,1,1,'A drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature&#39;s game statistics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you&#39;ve given it. To maintain the control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(12,'Animate Objects','5','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','120 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can&#39;t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animated Object Statistics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny - HP: 20, AC: 18, Attack: +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage, Str: 4, Dex: 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small - HP: 25, AC: 16, Attack: +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage, Str: 6, Dex: 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium - HP: 40, AC: 13, Attack: +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage, Str: 10, Dex: 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large - HP: 50, AC: 10, Attack: +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage, Str: 14, Dex: 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge - HP: 80, AC: 10, Attack: +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage, Str: 18, Dex: 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determine by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet, if the objects lack legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determine by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(13,'Antilife Shell','5','Abjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','Self (10-foot radius)',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier lasts for the duration. The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you move so that an affect creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(14,'Antimagic Field','8','Abjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','Self (10-foot-radius sphere)',1,1,1,'A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can&#39;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can&#39;t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn&#39;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can&#39;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon&#39;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (For example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magical Travel: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spells, temporarily closes while in the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dispel Magic: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don&#39;t nullify each other.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(15,'Antipathy/Sympathy','8','Enchantment','1 hour','10 days','60 feet',1,1,1,'Either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura&#39;s effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antipathy: The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can&#39;t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can&#39;t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sympathy: The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can&#39;t willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ending the Effect: If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. ON a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spells is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(16,'Arcane Eye','4','Divination','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','30 feet',1,1,1,'A bit of bat fur',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can&#39;t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye&#39;s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(17,'Arcane Gate','6','Conjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','500 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other, passing through a portal from the non-portal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(18,'Arcane Lock','2','Abjuration','1 action','Until dispelled','Touch',1,1,1,'Gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(19,'Armor of Agathys','1','Abjuration','1 action','1 hour','Self',1,1,1,'A cup of water',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(20,'Arms of Hadar','1','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','Self (10-foot radius)',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can&#39;t take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(21,'Astral Projection','9','Necromancy','1 hour','Special','10 feet',1,1,1,'For each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation, it doesn&#39;t need food or air and doesn&#39;t age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature&#39;s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature&#39;s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(22,'Augury','2','Divination','1 minute','Instantaneous','Self',1,1,1,'Specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one.

You cast that spell, called the contingent spell, as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn&#39;t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others.

The change lasts for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cause simple shapes-such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location-to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(83,'Control Water','4','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','300 feet',1,1,1,'A drop of water and a pinch of dust',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&#39;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&#39;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&#39;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&#39;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(84,'Control Weather','8','Transmutation','10 minutes','Concentration, up to 8 hours','Self (5-mile radius)',1,1,1,'Burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

Moving to a place where you don&#39;t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 x 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precipitation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 - Clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 - Light clouds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 - Overcast or ground fog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 4 - Rain, hail or snow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 5 - Torrential rain, driving hail or blizzard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 - Unbearable heat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 - Hot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 - Warm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 4 - Cool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 5 - Cold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 6 - Arctic cold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 - Calm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 - Moderate wind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 - Strong wind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 4 - Gale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 5 - Storm&lt;/p&gt;',1),(85,'Control Winds (EE)','5','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','300 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell&#39;s duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you&#39;ve halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gusts: A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction that you choose. You choose the intensity of the wind - calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downdraft: You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updraft: You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube&#39;s bottom edge. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(86,'Cordon of Arrows','2','Transmutation','1 action','8 hours','5 feet',1,1,1,'Four or more arrows or bolts',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition - arrows or crossbow bolts - in the ground within range and lay magic upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast this spell, you can designate any creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be affected increases by two for each slot level above 2nd&lt;/p&gt;',1),(87,'Counterspell','3','Abjuration','1 reaction','Instantaneous','60 feet',0,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell&#39;s level. On a success, the creature&#39;s spell fails and has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Level.

Until the spells ends, the bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire&#39;s space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it enters the bonfire&#39;s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(89,'Create Food and Water','3','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','30 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours.

(The DM has game statistics for these creatures.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights.

If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material - Duration: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetable matter - 1 day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone/crystal - 12 hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precious metals - 1 hour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gems - 10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adamantine/Mithral - 1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using any material created by this spell as another spell&#39;s material component causes that spell to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(93,'Crown of Madness','2','Enchantment','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','120 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.

The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends.

You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range.

Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of this spell&#39;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(98,'Darkvision','2','Transmutation','1 action','8 hours','Touch',1,1,1,'Either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark.

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell&#39;s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(102,'Demiplane','8','Conjuration','1 action','1 hour','60 feet',0,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(103,'Destructive Wave','5','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','Self (30-foot radius)',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(104,'Detect Evil and Good','1','Divination','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place of object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(105,'Detect Magic','1','Divination','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,1,'&lt;p&gt;For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(106,'Detect Poison and Disease','1','Divination','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','Self',1,1,1,'A yew leaf',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(107,'Detect Thoughts','2','Divination','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','Self',1,1,1,'A copper piece',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn&#39;t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature - what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature&#39;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature&#39;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature&#39;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check if it succeeds, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can&#39;t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can&#39;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn&#39;t speak any language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can&#39;t see it, but it must still be within range.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(108,'Dimension Door','4','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','500 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as 200 feet straight downward or upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&#39;t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(109,'Disguise Self','1','Illusion','1 action','1 hour','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You make yourself, including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person, look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&#39;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(110,'Disintegrate','6','Transmutation','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,1,'A lodestone and a pinch of dust',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by Wall of Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6+40 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(111,'Dispel Evil and Good','5','Abjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','Self',1,1,1,'Holy water or powdered silver and iron',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane.

The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dismissal: As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn&#39;t there already).

The DC equals 10 + the spell&#39;s level. On a successful check, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell&#39;s level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(113,'Dissonant Whispers','1','Enchantment','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain.

The creature doesn&#39;t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn&#39;t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(114,'Divination','4','Divination','1 action','Instantaneous','Self',1,1,1,'Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god&#39;s servants.

If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as Attack that creature, Run over there, or Fetch that object. If the creature completes the order and doesn&#39;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t pushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or small gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(124,'Earth Tremor (EE)','1','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','Self (10-foot radius)',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You cause a tremor in the ground in a 10-foot radius.

Fissures open throughout the spell&#39;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell&#39;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure&#39;s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure&#39;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.

Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlarge. The target&#39;s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn&#39;t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&#39;s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target&#39;s attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce. The target&#39;s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category - from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&#39;s weapons also shrink to match its new size.

If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.

In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can&#39;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar&#39;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form.

A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator.

If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(161,'Fly','3','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','Touch',1,1,1,'A wing feather from any bird',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You touch a willing creature.

For the duration, creatures can&#39;t teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following - celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell&#39;s area can&#39;t overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(164,'Forcecage','7','Evocation','1 action','1 hour','100 feet',1,1,1,'Ruby dust worth 1,500 gp',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range.

Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature inside the cage can&#39;t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can&#39;t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can&#39;t be dispelled by dispel magic.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(165,'Foresight','9','Divination','1 minute','8 hours','Touch',1,1,1,'A hummingbird feather',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future.

When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM&#39;s discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(168,'Frostbite (EE)','0','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range.

The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn&#39;t affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in this form, the target&#39;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can&#39;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can&#39;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can&#39;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn&#39;t work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature&#39;s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(171,'Geas','5','Enchantment','1 minute','30 days','60 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can&#39;t understand you is unaffected by the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(172,'Gentle Repose','2','Necromancy','1 action','10 days','Touch',1,1,1,'A pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse\'s eyes, which must remain there for the duration',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can&#39;t become undead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don&#39;t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(173,'Giant Insect','4','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','30 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(174,'Glibness','8','Transmutation','1 action','1 hour','Self',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15.

Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(176,'Glyph of Warding','3','Abjuration','1 hour','Until dispelled or triggered','Touch',1,1,1,'Incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes',1,0,'&lt;p&gt;When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken and the spell ends without being triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&#39;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(177,'Goodberry','1','Transmutation','1 action','Instantaneous','Touch',1,1,1,'A sprig of mistletoe',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack&#39;s normal effects, and green fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This spell&#39;s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corridors: Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doors: All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell.

You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Place magic mouth in two locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room. Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole warded area radiates magic.

Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area, you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as ores or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courage: Affected creatures can&#39;t be frightened while in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darkness: Darkness fills the area.

Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren&#39;t changed in appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn&#39;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it.

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(246,'Mass Cure Wounds','5','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(247,'Mass Heal','9','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(248,'Mass Healing Word','3','Evocation','1 bonus action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(249,'Mass Suggestion','6','Enchantment','1 action','24 hours','60 feet',1,0,1,'A snake\'s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn&#39;t met before the spell ends, the activity isn&#39;t performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(250,'Maximilian\'s Earthen Grasp (EE)','2','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','30 feet',1,1,1,'A miniature hand sculpted from clay',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell&#39;s duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(251,'Maze','8','Conjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(252,'Meld into Stone','3','Transmutation','1 action','8 hours','Touch',1,1,0,NULL,0,1,'&lt;p&gt;You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While merged with the stone, you can&#39;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can&#39;t move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor physical damage to the stone doesn&#39;t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone&#39;s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(253,'Melf\'s Acid Arrow','2','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','90 feet',1,1,1,'Powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder\'s stomach',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(254,'Melf\'s Minute Meteors (EE)','3','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','Self',1,1,1,'Niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell&#39;s duration. When you cast the spell-and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter-you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(255,'Mending','0','Transmutation','1 minute','Instantaneous','Touch',1,1,1,'Two lodestones',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn clack, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can&#39;t restore magic to such an object.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(256,'Message','0','Transmutation','1 action','1 round','120 feet',1,1,1,'A short piece of copper wire',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn&#39;t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(257,'Meteor Swarm','9','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','1 mile',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren&#39;t being worn or carried.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(258,'Mind Blank','8','Abjuration','1 action','24 hours','Touch',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target&#39;s mind or to gain information about the target.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(259,'Minor Illusion','0','Illusion','1 action','1 minute','30 feet',0,1,1,'A bit of fleece',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&#39;s voice, a lion&#39;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you create an image of an object - such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest - it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&#39;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(260,'Mirage Arcane','7','Illusion','10 minutes','10 days','Sight',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain&#39;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn&#39;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell&#39;s area disappears immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain&#39;s true form, however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion&#39;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(261,'Mirror Image','2','Illusion','1 action','1 minute','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it&#39;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell&#39;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack&#39;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A duplicate&#39;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can&#39;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(262,'Mislead','5','Illusion','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','Self',0,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(263,'Misty Step','2','Conjuration','1 bonus action','Instantaneous','Self',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(264,'Modify Memory','5','Enchantment','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','30 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You attempt to reshape another creature&#39;s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target&#39;s memories are modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this charm lasts, you can affect the target&#39;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature&#39;s memory isn&#39;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modified memory doesn&#39;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature&#39;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature&#39;s true memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target&#39;s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature&#39;s past (9th level).&lt;/p&gt;',1),(265,'Mold Earth (EE)','0','Transmutation','1 action','Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)','30 feet',0,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn&#39;t have enough force to cause damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(266,'Moonbeam','2','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','120 feet',1,1,1,'Several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a creature enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can&#39;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell&#39;s light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(267,'Mordenkainen\'s Faithful Hound','4','Conjuration','1 action','8 hours','30 feet',1,1,1,'A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can&#39;t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound&#39;s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(268,'Mordenkainen\'s Magnificent Mansion','7','Conjuration','1 minute','24 hours','300 feet',1,1,1,'A miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can&#39;t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can&#39;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can&#39;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(269,'Mordenkainen\'s Private Sanctum','4','Abjuration','10 minutes','24 hours','120 feet',1,1,1,'A thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Sound can&#39;t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Sensors created by divination spells can&#39;t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Creatures in the area can&#39;t be targeted by divination spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(270,'Mordenkainen\'s Sword','7','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','60 feet',1,1,1,'A miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range.

On a hit. the target takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(271,'Move Earth','6','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 2 hours','120 feet',1,1,1,'An iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils - clay, loam, and sand',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area&#39;s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can&#39;t exceed half the area&#39;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square&#39;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the terrain&#39;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can&#39;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground&#39;s movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can&#39;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, this spell doesn&#39;t directly affect plant growth.

The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False Aura: You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object&#39;s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mask: You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin&#39;s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(274,'Otiluke\'s Freezing Sphere','6','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','300 feet',1,1,1,'A small crystal sphere',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On successful save, it takes half as much damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling&#39;s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn&#39;t already shattered, it explodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th&lt;/p&gt;',1),(275,'Otiluke\'s Resilient Sphere','4','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','30 feet',1,1,1,'A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing, not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects, can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can&#39;t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere&#39;s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature&#39;s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(276,'Otto\'s Irresistible Dance','6','Enchantment','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','30 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place - shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(277,'Pass Without Trace','2','Abjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','Self',1,1,1,'Ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can&#39;t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(278,'Passwall','5','Transmutation','1 action','1 hour','30 feet',1,1,1,'A pinch of sesame seeds',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening&#39;s dimensions - up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(279,'Phantasmal Force','2','Illusion','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','60 feet',1,1,1,'A bit of fleece',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm&#39;s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm&#39;s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(280,'Phantasmal Killer','4','Illusion','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','120 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target&#39;s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(281,'Phantom Steed','3','Illusion','1 minute','1 hour','30 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,1,'&lt;p&gt;A Large quasi-real, horse-like creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature&#39;s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(282,'Planar Ally','6','Conjuration','10 minutes','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you - a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature&#39;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM&#39;s choice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&#39;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature&#39;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature&#39;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(283,'Planar Binding','5','Abjuration','1 hour','24 hours','60 feet',1,1,1,'A jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell&#39;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(284,'Plane Shift','7','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','Touch',1,1,1,'A forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM&#39;s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails the save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(285,'Plant Growth','3','Transmutation','1 action or 8 hours','Instantaneous','150 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell&#39;s area from being affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(286,'Poison Spray','0','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','10 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17 level (4d12).&lt;/p&gt;',1),(287,'Polymorph','4','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','60 feet',1,1,1,'A caterpillar cocoon',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell transforms a creature with at least 1 hit point that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&#39;s (or the target&#39;s level, if it doesn&#39;t have a challenge rating). The target&#39;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&#39;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(288,'Power Word Heal','9','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','Touch',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(289,'Power Word Kill','9','Enchantment','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly.

Otherwise, the spell has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(290,'Power Word Stun','8','Enchantment','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(292,'Prestidigitation','0','Transmutation','1 action','Up to 1 hour','10 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(293,'Primordial Ward (EE)','6','Abjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage for the spell&#39;s duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you take damage of one of those types, you can use your reaction to gain immunity to that type of damage, including against the triggering damage. If you do so, the resistances end, and you have the immunity until the end of your next turn, at which time the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(294,'Prismatic Spray','7','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','Self (60 foot cone)',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-Red: The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-Orange: The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-Yellow: The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-Green: The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5-Blue: The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-Indigo: On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7-Violet: On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM&#39;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&#39;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8-Special: The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(295,'Prismatic Wall','9','Abjuration','1 action','10 minutes','60 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall - up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick - entered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted. The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall&#39;s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer&#39;s properties as described below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red: The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can&#39;t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange: The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can&#39;t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow: The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green: The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue: The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indigo: On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&#39;t need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, spells can&#39;t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violet: On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM&#39;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&#39;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(296,'Produce Flame','0','Conjuration','1 action','10 minutes','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).&lt;/p&gt;',1),(297,'Programmed Illusion','6','Illusion','1 action','Until dispelled','120 feet',1,1,1,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area.

A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell disguises physical appearances as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in-between. You can&#39;t change a target&#39;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspections. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature&#39;s outfit objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature&#39;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner then you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

This movement doesn&#39;t have enough force to cause damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You change the water&#39;s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(327,'Shapechange','9','Transmutation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','Self',1,1,1,'A jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You assume the form of a different creature for the duration.

You can&#39;t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#39;t knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can&#39;t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#39;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#39;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#39;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this spell&#39;s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception - if your new form has more hit pints than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(328,'Shatter','2','Evocation','1 action','Instantaneous','60 feet',1,1,1,'A chip of mica',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range.

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains.

The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn&#39;t return the creature&#39;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can&#39;t learn new information, doesn&#39;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can&#39;t speculate about future events.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(344,'Speak with Plants','3','Transmutation','1 action','10 minutes','Self (30-foot radius)',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands.

An affected creature&#39;s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil).

Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell&#39;s effect resemble that weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(349,'Staggering Smite','4','Evocation','1 bonus action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','Self',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell&#39;s duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target.

The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling.

Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it purses the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.

If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature&#39;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don&#39;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Object: You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn&#39;t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature&#39;s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(363,'Telepathy','8','Evocation','1 action','24 hours','Unlimited',1,1,1,'A pair of linked silver rings',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(364,'Teleport','7','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','10 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can&#39;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity - Mishap - Similar Area - Off Target - On Target&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permanent Circle - x - x - x - 01-100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Object - x - x - x - 01-100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very Familiar - 01-05 - 06-13 - 14-24 - 25-100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seen Casually - 01-33 - 34-43 - 44-53 - 54-100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewed Once - 01-43 - 44-53 - 54-73 - 74-100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description - 01-43 - 44-53 - 54-73 - 74-100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;False Description - 01-50 - 51-100 - x - x&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity: &#34;Permanent Circle&#34; means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. &#34;Associated Object&#34; means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard&#39;s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a Lich&#39;s secret tomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Very Familiar&#34; is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. &#34;Seen Casually&#34; is some place you have seen more than once but with which you aren&#39;t very familiar. &#34;Viewed Once&#34; is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. &#34;Description&#34; is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else&#39;s description, perhaps from a map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;False Description&#34; is a place that doesn&#39;t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy&#39;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be travelled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as north-east, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that&#39;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard&#39;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mishap: The spell&#39;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).&lt;/p&gt;',1),(365,'Teleportation Circle','5','Conjuration','1 minute','1 round','10 feet',1,0,1,'Rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence - a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(366,'Tenser\'s Floating Disk','1','Conjuration','1 action','1 hour','30 feet',1,1,1,'A drop of mercury',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can more across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can&#39;t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can&#39;t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can&#39;t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(367,'Thaumaturgy','0','Transmutation','1 action','Up to 1 minute','30 feet',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t pushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&#39;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(372,'Tidal Wave (EE)','3','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','120 feet',1,1,1,'A drop of water',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t knocked prone.

Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make this save the first time it enters the area on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transmute Mud to Rock: Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell&#39;s duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a Strength check (DC 20) or by dealing 25 damage to the rock around it.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shapechangers aren&#39;t affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn&#39;t affected by this spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creature into Creature: If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&#39;s (or its level, if the target doesn&#39;t have a challenge rating). The target&#39;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&#39;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Object into Creature: You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature&#39;s size is no larger than the object&#39;s size and the creature&#39;s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature&#39;s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creature into Object: If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature&#39;s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(379,'True Resurrection','9','Necromancy','1 hour','Instantaneous','Touch',1,1,1,'A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age.

The spell replaces damaged or missing organs or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature&#39;s name.

Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall&#39;s height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can&#39;t move.

If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(384,'Vampiric Touch','3','Necromancy','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','Self',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon force from others to heal your wounds.

The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature&#39;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can&#39;t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(389,'Wall of Ice','6','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','120 feet',1,1,1,'A small piece of quartz',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with radium of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the wall cuts through a creature&#39;s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(390,'Wall of Sand (EE)','3','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','90 feet',1,1,1,'A handful of sand',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure up a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of sight but not movement. A creature is blinded while in the wall&#39;s space and must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(391,'Wall of Stone','5','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','120 feet',1,1,1,'A small block of granite',1,0,'&lt;p&gt;A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least on other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the wall cuts through a creature&#39;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&#39;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn&#39;t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM&#39;s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&#39;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(392,'Wall of Thorns','6','Conjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','120 feet',1,1,1,'A handful of thorns',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(393,'Wall of Water (EE)','3','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','60 feet',1,1,1,'A drop of water',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall&#39;s space is difficult terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall&#39;s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall&#39;s water doesn&#39;t fill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(394,'Warding Bond','2','Abjuration','1 action','1 hour','Touch',1,1,1,'A pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and target must wear for the duration',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(395,'Warding Wind (EE)','2','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 10 minutes','Self',1,0,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell&#39;s duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wind has the following effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It deafens you and other creatures in its area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(396,'Water Breathing','3','Transmutation','1 action','24 hours','30 feet',1,1,1,'A short reed or piece of straw',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(397,'Water Walk','3','Transmutation','1 action','1 hour','30 feet',1,1,1,'A piece of cork',0,1,'&lt;p&gt;This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface - such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava - as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(398,'Watery Sphere (EE)','4','Conjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','90 feet',1,1,1,'A droplet of water',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure up a sphere of water with a 10-foot radius on a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover in the air, but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell&#39;s duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any creature in the sphere&#39;s space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside it. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sphere can restrain a maximum of four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature in excess of these numbers, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet over ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw, but no more than once per turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(399,'Web','2','Conjuration','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 hour','60 feet',1,1,1,'A bit of spider web',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the webs aren&#39;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature restrained by the webs can use its actions to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(400,'Weird','9','Illusion','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','120 feet',1,1,0,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature&#39;s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature&#39;s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(401,'Whirlwind (EE)','7','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','300 feet',1,0,1,'A piece of straw',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A whirlwind howls down to a point on the ground you specify. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren&#39;t secured to anything and that aren&#39;t worn or carried by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 x 10 feet away from it in a random direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spell can be found in the Elemental Evil Player&#39;s Companion&lt;/p&gt;',2),(402,'Wind Walk','6','Transmutation','1 minute','8 hours','30 feet',1,1,1,'Fire and holy water',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can&#39;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can&#39;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(403,'Wind Wall','3','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','120 feet',1,1,1,'A tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can&#39;t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can&#39;t pass through it.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(404,'Wish','9','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','Self',1,1,1,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don&#39;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn&#39;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich&#39;s life drain attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent&#39;s successful save, a foe&#39;s critical hit, or a friend&#39;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance, the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item&#39;s current owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can&#39;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn&#39;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(405,'Witch Bolt','1','Evocation','1 action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','30 feet',1,1,1,'A twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning',0,0,'&lt;p&gt;A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell&#39;s range or if it has total cover from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(406,'Word of Recall','6','Conjuration','1 action','Instantaneous','5 feet',1,1,1,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn&#39;t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(407,'Wrathful Smite','1','Evocation','1 bonus action','Concentration, up to 1 minute','Self',1,1,1,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell&#39;s duration, your attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.&lt;/p&gt;',1),(408,'Zone of Truth','2','Enchantment','1 action','10 minutes','60 feet',1,1,1,NULL,0,0,'&lt;p&gt;You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can&#39;t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;',1);
